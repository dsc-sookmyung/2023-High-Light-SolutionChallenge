## ✨ Why LeTurn?

&nbsp; "LeTurn" is an independent learning support app designed for low vision college students. The app converts lecture materials that do not support voice over functionality, enabling low vision college students to learn independently and conveniently. Our goal is to provide low vision students with an equal educational environment, free from constraints and disparities in learning.

## 💬 Introduction

&nbsp; Most universities in South Korea provide lecture materials in the form of PDF files, which low vision students need to learn through the screen reader function on their device. However, we found that none of the various document apps we tried were suitable for low vision users. Some documents were not supported by the voiceover function, while others only read out individual words or entire pages, making it impossible for visually impaired students to learn effectively using the basic voiceover function. <br>

<h3 align="center"><b>So,</b></h3>

&nbsp; We are dedicated to improving the educational experience of low vision college students. We developed an app with various features to enable low vision students to learn lecture materials independently. This app extracts texts and images from uploaded files and reorganizes them by page. It provides TTS files for each paragraph, allowing for pause, replay, and speed control, while enabling repetition of necessary parts and full-screen viewing of images. <br>

&nbsp; These features enhance the learning accessibility for low vision students, enabling them to participate in education and learning without difficulties.

## 🎯 Goal

&nbsp; The goal of our service is to address the issue of educational inequality faced by individuals with low vision, and to assist those with low vision in achieving independent learning. To achieve this goal, we provide a lecture materials conversion service that offers an interface optimized for auditory learning and enhances accessibility for all users. Through this, we aim to alleviate educational inequality and contribute to providing equal educational opportunities for all students.
